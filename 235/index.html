                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I love Computer Science and Video Games. However besides the obvious I am also interested
                    in cooking and maintaining a healthy lifestyle by getting a good amount of exercise.
                    I hope to learn as much as possible during my time here at RIT.
                    Out of this class, I am hoping to get a good grasp on how to make more professional websites
                    and webgames, and to increase my knowledge so I am further prepared for coops. Out of my major,
                    I hope to become as marketable as possible for future job opportunities, in the case I can't get
                    a job in Game Development, I may be able to get a job in Software or Web Development. Once I graduate
                    I want to obtain a job that I end up loving and I want to know I did my best to prepare, so I will 
                    do anything to understand any content I am struggling with so I can be more competent in the competitive
                    work environment that this field of study has.
