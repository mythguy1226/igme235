    <h1>Project 1 Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Currently my goal for this project is to get the design
        completed for my portfolio webpage so that I can later
        add projects to it. The audience I am trying to get are employers
        as well as anyone who can spread the word about what I have created
        so I can make a name for myself. I plan on adding a navigation bar at
        the top of the page so people don't have to scroll all the way down to
        see certain content. I also need a header to grab people's attention
        immediately as they load the page. Adding a big header with an image
        would usually grab someone's attention. I want my layout to be very straight forward
        and easy for the user to see what everything is supposed to be. Below is the original
        design for my webpage layout.

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>
        All images used for this site were taken by me,<br>
        however I used a font from google fonts called secular one.<br>
        The link to that is right here<br>
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Secular+One?query=secular">https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Secular+One?query=secular</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Dimension/Update notes</h2>
    <p>
        For the image dimensions I decided to use the vw unit
        when sizing because the webpage needs to be responsive so by using 
        vws, the images will keep their size  relative to the screen size 
        and not become too big or too small. For updates for my final version,
        I plan on possibly adding a drop down menu for mobile devices and keep
        the bar for desktop so it looks a bit more compact on mobile devices.
        As I add projects to the gallery I plan on making the project links going
        to either the github repository I made for it or making a different place
        for me to present those projects.
