                    My name is Robert Reddick and my hometown is Brockport, New York. I'm a second year undergraduate student
                    at RIT majoring in Game Design and Development. I also plan on taking on a minor in Computing Security. Ever
                    since I was very young I have always loved computer science and have aspired to make my ideas and others ideas
                    come to life. Throughout the years I have gained quite a bit of experience and am comfortable with using
                    Java, Javascript, C#, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with using Visual Studio, Monogame, Maya, Unity,
                    and Photoshop CC.

                    Description: This is a 2D Top-down shooter game where the player is a mutant who underwent experiments with
                    a new virus that gave him special abilities but deformed the rest of the human population leaving him as a 
                    survivor amongst endless waves of the undead. In this game the player fights zombies in wave-based combat and 
                    has access to a variety of abilities which can all be accessed through a shop found in the pause menu. This game 
                    was created using Javascript and PixiJS.<br>

                    Description: A wep app used for displaying characters from the Marvel Universe. This was made using Javascript and
                    the Marvel API. It can be used to display a description of the character, as well as comics and events that character
                    was in. You can also do more general searches by searching by what the character name starts with.<br>

                    This Project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids
                    but with some differences. It is a 2D Shoot 'em up where the player
                    must survive waves of obstacles with increasing difficulty.<br>
