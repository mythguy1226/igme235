                <p>
                    My name is Robert Reddick and my hometown is Brockport, New York. I'm a second year undergraduate student
                    at RIT majoring in Game Design and Development. I also plan on taking on a minor in Computing Security. Ever
                    since I was very young I have always loved computer science and have aspired to make my ideas and others ideas
                    come to life. Throughout the years I have gained quite a bit of experience and am comfortable with using
                    Java, Javascript, C#, Python, HTML, and CSS. I am also familiar with using Visual Studio, Monogame, Maya, Unity,
                    and Photoshop CC.

                <p>
                    Description: A 2D platformer game where you take a traditional dungeon game and you flip it upside down. You the player
                    are the weak enemy trying to keep the hero from surviving the end of the dungeon. You are too weak to defeat him
                    alone so you must retreat further into the dungeon to gather more enemies to aid you in defeating the hero. If the hero
                    makes it to the end of the dungeon or defeats you then you lose, but if you manage to defeat the hero you win!

                <p>
                    Description: A wep app used for displaying characters from the Marvel Universe. This was made using Javascript and
                    the Marvel API. It can be used to display a description of the character, as well as comics and events that character
                    was in. You can also do more general searches by searching by what the character name starts with.

                <p>
                    This Project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids
                    but with some differences. It is a 2D Shoot 'em up where the player
                    must survive waves of obstacles with increasing difficulty.
