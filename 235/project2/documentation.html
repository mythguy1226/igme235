    <h1>Project 2 Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
        I started off this project by first testing the Marvel API
        to make sure I can get the information needed to make the web app work. 
        Once that was working I started to make the base of my layout using CSS grid and 
        flexbox. My goal was to try to keep the content somewhat compact so the user wouldnt 
        have to do too much scrolling throughout the page. Once I had the layout set up I began to 
        add more styles to make the page look nice with it's base function which was searching for 
        a character directly. Once that was all working, I moved on to add the 3 different filters which 
        included comics that character debuted in and events the character was a part of. After those were
        complete I began to work on my last control which would search for any characters that start with the 
        term specified in the search bar. A list of buttons are then shown and the number of characters shown at a time
        can be changed with the limit dropdown. Clicking on one of the buttons would give the information on the selected
        character with selected filters having an effect on what information is shown. Lastly, I implemented use of local
        storage to save the user's last searched character. This will work with both direct searches and general searches.
        After everything was functional I just did some polishing to my CSS so that it looks a bit nicer overall.<br>
        Below is the original design for my webpage layout. <br>
        But as you can see I made some edits to the design since then.

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        I feel I have met all requirements for this project for both functionality and design.<br>
        Local storage is used to save the user's last searched term and stores the last character that
        was searched.<br>
        There are a minimum of 3 controls used which include, search bar, search button, limit dropdwon, 
        comics filter, events filter, and the search by begins with filter.<br>
        My extra control is the begins with filter and it will take a list of all characters that begin with
        the term the user puts in the search bar and then display buttons for them to select a character to
        search for.<br>
        The code is also error free and commented<br>
        I feel the design is pleasing to look at and it doesnt resemble the GIPHY's UI design at all. <br>
        All widgets are labeled so there shouldnt be any question as to what control does what in this web app<br>
        User errors are also handled effectively, if the user types in a character that doesnt exist and the begins with
        filter is turned off then it will say "not found", and when the user doesnt put anything in the search bar a message
        pops up in the content area to tell the user to put something in the search bar. <br>
        The webpage is fairly responsive, it should work well on most screen sizes and definitely works well on the
        dimensions specified (1024x768). I also changed the grid layout on smaller screens so it looks better on
        mobile devices.<br>
        HTML and CSS is valid, however I found some warnings due to me not having a header right after my section tags. I was 
        originally using divs but assumed you wanted sections because they are semantic tags.<br>
