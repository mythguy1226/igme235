            <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to that of a zombie apocalypse game, but with a twist!
                The player has special powers rather than a simple gun, it's like
                an apocalyptic game met a magic dungeon crawler and came out with this.

            <h2>III. Platform</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>IV. Story</h2>
            <p>
                It all started when a group of scientists were trying to find ways to force evolution on the human race
                and enhance their natural abilities. They made a scientific breakthrough and it worked on their first patient,
                but soon after they became deathly ill and mutated into the first zombie, along with it the beginning of something else.
                In the outbreak of a Zombie Apocalypse you (the player) are a survivor who was experimented on before
                the sudden outbreak of the virus. The effects of the virus on you had a rather unique effect mutating
                you to have special abilities many would consider to be unnatural, but you seemed to have some 
                natural immunity to the ill effects of the virus and you didnt deform. While the virus was able to mutate you
                enhancing your biology, it deformed the rest of humanity leaving them as blood thirsty, and extremely contagious
                zombies who's goal is to infect all survivors and bring an end to humanity. The mood of this game will be darker
                and should really give off the impression that an apocalypse would to whoever is playing. The goal of the game
                is to survive as long as possible without getting killed by the hordes of zombies coming for you. Progression in 
                this game will be wave based where more zombies will spawn upon each wave.

            <h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
            <p>
                The overall look of this game will use simple 2D Pixel Graphics that will be
                similar to an arcade style game.<br>
                The sounds in this game will be simple, most likely some 8-bit and techno, and possibly
                some ambient sounds to help set the mood even further. <br>
                Types of sounds will include, sounds made by the player, some background sounds, sounds made
                by the zombies, and perhaps some UI sounds.

                The player will be introduced with an instructions screen when they click
                on the start button which will force them to basically read it or acknowledge it
                before playing the game.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Learning the Game:</b><br>
                As the player goes throughout the game they will learn that they will need to keep their distance
                to the enemies so that they don't get easily overwhelmed. As time goes on the waves will get harder
                so the player is going to need to learn to upgrade their abilities or unlock new ones to develop their
                own play style for surviving the longest.
