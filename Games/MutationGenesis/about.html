            <h1>Mutation Genesis</h1>
            <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to that of a zombie apocalypse game, but with a twist!
                The player has special powers rather than a simple gun, it's like
                an apocalyptic game met a magic dungeon crawler and came out with this.

            <h2>II. Genre</h2>
            <p>
                Gameplay Genre: Top-down Shooter<br>
                IGN Genre: Action<br>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>III. Platform</h2>
            <p>
                Will be friendly with most screen-sizes but will mostly
                be available across different desktops.
            </p>

            <h2>IV. Story</h2>
            <p>
                It all started when a group of scientists were trying to find ways to force evolution on the human race
                and enhance their natural abilities. They made a scientific breakthrough and it worked on their first patient,
                but soon after they became deathly ill and mutated into the first zombie, along with it the beginning of something else.
                In the outbreak of a Zombie Apocalypse you (the player) are a survivor who was experimented on before
                the sudden outbreak of the virus. The effects of the virus on you had a rather unique effect mutating
                you to have special abilities many would consider to be unnatural, but you seemed to have some 
                natural immunity to the ill effects of the virus and you didnt deform. While the virus was able to mutate you
                enhancing your biology, it deformed the rest of humanity leaving them as blood thirsty, and extremely contagious
                zombies who's goal is to infect all survivors and bring an end to humanity. The mood of this game will be darker
                and should really give off the impression that an apocalypse would to whoever is playing. The goal of the game
                is to survive as long as possible without getting killed by the hordes of zombies coming for you. Progression in 
                this game will be wave based where more zombies will spawn upon each wave.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
            <p>
                The overall look of this game will use simple 2D Pixel Graphics that will be
                similar to an arcade style game.<br>
                The sounds in this game will be simple, most likely some 8-bit and techno, and possibly
                some ambient sounds to help set the mood even further. <br>
                Types of sounds will include, sounds made by the player, some background sounds, sounds made
                by the zombies, and perhaps some UI sounds.
            </p>

                - Upgrading Abilities: Accessed through shop which can be found through pause menu<br>
                <br>
                <b>Controls:</b> <br>
                - Movement: WASD<br>

                <b>Teaching the Game:</b><br>
                The player will be introduced with an instructions screen when they click
                on the start button which will force them to basically read it or acknowledge it
                before playing the game.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Learning the Game:</b><br>
                As the player goes throughout the game they will learn that they will need to keep their distance
                to the enemies so that they don't get easily overwhelmed. As time goes on the waves will get harder
                so the player is going to need to learn to upgrade their abilities or unlock new ones to develop their
                own play style for surviving the longest.

            <h1>Documentation</h1>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>Creating Main Screens</h3>
            <p>
                I started this project off by creating the 4 main screens for the game 
                which include, the main menu, instructions screen, gameplay screen, and the game over menu.
                The Main Menu is just a hub to start at before going into the game to play, once the Player
                clicks the button they are brought to the Instructions screen where the main objective and 
                controls of the game are stated. The player can then start the game when they are done reading
                by pressing the button. While in the game the user can see their current score, wave, health, and 
                zombie count. The game over screen is not yet achievable because the player isnt made yet.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Creating Spritesheets</h3>
            <p>
                Now that screens are made, what needs to be created is the Spritesheets. I started with the player's 
                Spritesheet because my next step is setting up the basic controls for the player. Using some free Assets
                I used Photoshop to put together the spritesheet for the Player and the 4 different rotations/directions he can 
                face. I did the same for the Zombie Spritesheet which also utilized free assets I found online. Lastly I had to create 
                the Spell Spritesheet which I made completely on my own using Photoshop. I then exported the Spritesheets and loaded them
                into the game.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Setting up Player Movement</h3>
            <p>
                Using the Player Spritesheet I set up in the previous step, I set up the different frames for the different
                player animations. Once those were created I put player input responses into the game loop. Each time the player
                switches directions they will face the direction they are moving and their direction variable will be updated. The different 
                inputs used to make the player move are WASD.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Setting up Zombies</h3>
            <p>
                Using the Zombie Spritesheet, I set up the different frames for each direction the zombie faces when moving. In the game loop
                I made the zombies move in response to the location of the player, and they will change directions based on the direction they
                happen to be facing when seeking the player. When the zombie is created certain fields such as their health and location are 
                stored in the object and then the zombie is pushed to an array storing all zombies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Setting up Player Abilities</h3>
            <p>
                Now that both the Player and Zombie can move, the next step is making each Ability. There are 6 abilities with their own unique 
                effect on zombies. The spell that will come out depends on the value of the variable holding the active spell. The default is 
                bio-electric blast, which does normal damage to zombies. The other abilities are Heat Wave which damages zombies and sets them on
                fire, Force Push which damages and knocks the zombies back a bit, Fireball which deals massive damage and sets the zombie on fire,
                freeze which damages and slows zombie movement, and finally Acid Shot which melts the zombie over time. To achieve the burning effect
                and freezing effect I set different timers using delta time and as long as the timer is running the corresponding effect will stay active 
                on the zombie. I also used timers to make different cooldowns for each spell to prevent spell spam.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Collision Detection</h3>
            <p>
                At first I was using AABB Collision Detection but found it wasnt as accurate as I wanted it to be. To improve collisions I 
                implemented my own method for Bounding Circle Collision Detection which takes a radius and if the two bounding circles 
                overlap then a collison is present. This takes out the inaccuracies that came with two corners of the boxes touching because 
                it didnt even look like the two were touching and it would have frustrated many players.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Implementing Ability Switch</h3>
            <p>
                Next step was making the mechanic for switching between abilities. I added a button to the top right of
                the screen which is used to activate the ability switch and below it displays the current active ability. 
                Using an array to hold all unlocked spells I got the current index of the active spell in the array and then moved to the 
                next index in the array and set it as the new active ability. If the index went out of bounds then I set the index to 0 so 
                it goes to the beginning of the array.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Creating Barriers</h3>
            <p>
                Using a Sprite I created in Photoshop I made a class for spawning Barriers in different locations on the map. 
                There are 3 barriers which are all stored in an array for further use when Wave Progression is implemented. These
                basically server as a spawn point for new zombies that come in during each wave. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Implementing Wave Progression</h3>
            <p>
                First what I did for this step was I put a tracker in the game loop that constantly checks how many zombies are currently in the 
                game. If there are none left meaning the zombies array is empty, then a new wave is ready to begin. 
                Once the condition is met a method will activate which increases the zombie count and wave number. 
                When the new wave starts the amount of zombies present that wave will be randomly spread among the 3 
                barriers. To prevent a drop in FPS from too many zombies I capped the zombie count to 40 zombies but to keep up the challenge 
                If the zombie cap is reached then every wave the zombies will begin to get faster.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Creating Pause Menu</h3>
            <p>
                Now that the main functions of the game are made the pause menu is ready to be made. This menu involves
                a label that tells the player their current score which also tells them how much money they can use. It also 
                includes a list of abilities they can upgrade and buy. By default all spells except bio-electric blast are locked 
                so they are grayed out to indicate that. This menu can be activated using the Q key (Originally it was P but for more 
                ease for the player I made it Q since their fingers are already close to that key)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Implementing Upgrade/Buy Shop</h3>
            <p>
                Now that the menu is set up the functions needed to upgrade and buy abilities are ready to be made. First the player is 
                going to need to be able to buy new abilities. Each button in the list will buy the corresponding ability depending on its 
                price. Once the ability is bought it will be pushed to the unlocked abilities array where the player can now access it through
                switching abilities. Now that all abilities can be achieved they must be upgradable. Each button will upgrade it's corresponding 
                Ability progessively getting more expensive and all abilities max out at 10. Bio-electric blast upgrades include damage increase, 
                Heat wave upgrades include a damage increase as well as a burn timer increase, Force push upgrades include a damage increase as well 
                as a knockback distance increase, Fireball upgrades increase damage, Freeze upgrades increase damage and it's freeze timer, and finally 
                the Acid Shot upgrades increase damage as well as the acid burn timer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Adding Sound</h3>
            <p>
                Now that the game is fully functional with wave based combat and a shop to buy/upgrade new abilities it's time to 
                add in sound assets. Using free sound assets I found online I was able to link unique sounds to each spell, zombie moans, hurt sounds,
                and a death sound, a player death sound, and finally some sounds that play when buttons are activated. These are all meant to further 
                enhance the experience brought by the game.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Final Touches</h3>
            <p>
                After taking critiques from the game Prototype some final touches were implemented to the game. Player movement is now less delayed 
                and you no longer have to wrestle with the controls to shoot in the right direction. The colors on the screens are now changed to make text easier to 
                read, before they didnt really blend well and it was hard for some people to read. I also added an option for players to
                use the E key for switching Abilities as well as using the button. Lastly, I added damage indicators for the zombies 
                when they are hit by a spell, and I did some final balancing to make sure the game is not too easy and not too hard.
            </p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <h3>Functional</h3>
            <p>
                The game is very easy to use and it's functionality goes beyond what we learned
                in class with the Ball Blast HW. I added many features such as different spell types,
                keyboard input, wave based combat, and a shop for upgrading/buying abilities. I used the 
                Javascript and PixiJS tech stack mainly because after doing the HW I already had a good feel of
                what types of projects I could make with it, and I knew I was going to have good resources for any
                trouble I ran into due to Prof. Chin's tutorials posted on youtube.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Deign and Interaction</h3>
            <p>
                Layout of the game is fairly simple and instructions are given
                to the player before they can even jump into gameplay. This forces the user
                to at least acknowledge that help is given in learning how to play. Controls are 
                also very commonly used such as WASD for movement and Space to activate an attack so 
                if the player had skipped over the instructions it shouldnt take them long to figure out how to use 
                the main gameplay controls. It is also responsive enough to fit onto screens with a width of 600px, not 
                too great for mobile but for most laptops and PCs it should work fine.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Media</h3>
            <p>
                I used many different Spritesheets and sounds to enhance the experience of the game all which were
                either pulled from an online source or were created by me. The images and sounds used are meant to 
                further give off the zombie apocalypse theme.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
            <p>
                HTML and CSS Validates, Semantic elements are used, and most CSS is external
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Code Conventions</h3>
            <p>
                I utilized one ES6 class in this project and it was used for creating the Barriers.
                I used it to better hold the barrier's location so it could be accessed when I went to go 
                spawn zombies for future waves. The rest of my code follows the other coding conventions and is 
                well commented throughout each file.
