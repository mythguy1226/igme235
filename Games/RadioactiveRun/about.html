            <h1>Radioactive Run</h1>
            <h2>I. High Concept</h2>
            <p>
                Simple Sidescroller similar to that of Geometry Dash,
                except in this you are also trying to escape a radiation leak
                while you try to reach the end of the level.
            </p>

            <h2>II. Genre</h2>
            <p>
                Gameplay Genre: Side Scroller/Platformer<br>
                IGN Genre: Action<br>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>III. Platform</h2>
            <p>
                Will be friendly with most screen-sizes but will mostly
                be available across different desktops.

            <h2>IV. Story</h2>
            <p>
                It began when a group of scientists were doing work on a Nuclear Reactor, while they were doing this, 
                one of the scientists tried to kill the rest of his fellow scientists by leaking out the radiation. You 
                are one of the surviving scientists trying to escape the plant and get to safety. As you (the player) run
                away from the radioactive wave you face many obstacles such as debris and other scientists who conspired 
                with the culprit to destroy you.
            </p>

            <h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
            <p>
                The overall look of this game will use simple 2D Pixel Graphics that will be
                similar to an arcade style game.<br>
                The sounds in this game will be simple, most likely some 8-bit and techno, and possibly
                some ambient sounds to help set the mood even further. <br>
                Types of sounds will include, sounds made by the player, some background sounds,
                and perhaps some UI sounds.
            </p>

                - Breaking through obstacles<br>
                - Picking up Powerups<br>
                <br>
                <b>Controls:</b> <br>

                <b>Teaching the Game:</b><br>
                The player will be introduced with an instructions screen when they click
                on the start button which will force them to basically read it or acknowledge it
                before playing the game.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Learning the Game:</b><br>
                As the player goes throughout the game they will learn that they need to stay very
                attentive as they progress through the levels because there will be a variety of
                different obstacles that will require them to avoid or break through so they dont get 
                caught by the radiation.
